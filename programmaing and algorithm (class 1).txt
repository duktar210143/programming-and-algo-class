programming language
a set of data given to a computer to perform ceertain task 
automatically is programming language
low level language:
the language which is used to write a program
in a particular machine and that runs only on that 
machine.
(machine dependent)
types
machine language:language which is written in binary form(0and 1)
ex:10001,1111,00001,1110
ADVANTAGES:
1. machine can directly understand
off:0
on:1
2. it executes a task the fastest
DISADVANTAGES:
-it isn't understood by person.
-it is not redble.
-Hard to maintain

2)ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE(language which is written by using mnemonics)
Mnemonics- short english word-ADD,SUB,MUT,DIV,REG
ex: ADD 1001,000111
advantages:
-easy to understand
-redable
-maintanable
disadvantages:
it needs a translator.(name of translator=assembler)
def tanslator-it is application used to convert one form
 of language into another form of language)
def assembler-it is a translator which is used to convert assembly language into machine codes


HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE:
(languageh wich are not machine independent)
types(c,c==,java,Ruby,python,c# etc)
ADVANTAGES:
- it is similar to english language
-it is redable
-it is maintainable
DISADVANTAGES
it needs a translator-types 1<compiler>2<Interpreter>
compiler:scans all the source code once and converts into machine code.
-compilation process will be faster
Interpreter:scans the code line by line and convert it into machine code.
 -interprtation will not be as fast as compiler

IMP QUES-DIFF BETWEEN COMPILER AND INTERPRETER??
IMP QUESTIONS(DIFFERENCE BTN HIGH LEVEL AND LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE)
IMP:MENTION ONE ADVANTAGE AND DIADAVANTAGES OF HIGH LEVEL AND LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE)

platform dependent
platform independent
